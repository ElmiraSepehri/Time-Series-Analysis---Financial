# Time-Series-Analysis---Financial
In this project I will conduct time series analysis of the financial data.
A time series is a set of observations at different points in time. A time series can have a fixed frequency of measured points (i.e. monthly), or have an irregular frequency of data points which are irregularly spaced in time (i.e. whenever data is available).
I will download the adjusted close prices for FB, MMM, IBM and AMZN for the last 60 months.
Then I will resample the data to get prices for the end of the business month and will select the Adjusted Close for each stock.
My aim is understanding whether there any autocorrelation between prices, monthly returns and different stocks?
